# Project Overview

Code and documentation for the Software Engineering Summative 1 Assignment: Meeting cost calculator application. 

## Project Introduction

The purpose of this project is to develop a simple meeting cost calculator, which can be adopted within my workplace to consider whether the cost of a meeting is an effective use of public money. The tool will allow a user to calculate the personnel cost of a meeting, using salary band information across various grades within the department. The project aims to provide a simple user interface which allows quick calculation of this cost.

As a public sector organisation, we must constantly consider our use of public funds and have a duty to ensure these are used in a way that both avoids waste and ensures value for money. This includes the use of employee time as salaries are funded through public money. This project therefore aims to provide teams with ability to better understand the costs of their meetings in order to prompt behavioural changes and get employees to consider the currently invisible cost of time. A tool to quickly and easily calculate this would enable employees to be more proactive in decision making around whether the purpose and intended outcomes of a meeting justify this cost.
